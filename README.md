task-manager
============

a prototype for user-centered project management. where most systems view
users as a collection of associations to unique groups, this one tries to
build a mental model of the application where groups are meta-data that emerge
from the connections between users collaborating on an action-oriented artifact.
my hope is that this is a cleaner and finer honed model for collaborative
action amongst small groups.

it's a work in progress though...
